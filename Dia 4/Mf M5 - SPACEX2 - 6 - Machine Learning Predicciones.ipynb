Por lo tanto, si podemos determinar si la primera etapa aterrizará, podemos determinar el coste de un lanzamiento. Esta información puede utilizarse si una empresa alternativa quiere pujar contra Space X por el lanzamiento de un cohete.   En este laboratorio, crearás una línea de aprendizaje automático para predecir si la primera etapa aterrizará dados los datos de los laboratorios anteriores."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k9lMYVQOqdPC"},"source":["## Objetivos"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G8WrOteyqdPC"},"source":["Realizar un análisis exploratorio de los datos y determinar las etiquetas de formación\n","\n","* Crear una columna para la clase\n","* Estandarizar los datos\n","* Dividir en datos de entrenamiento y datos de prueba\n","\n","\\-Encontrar el mejor hiperparámetro para SVM, árboles de clasificación y regresión logística\n","\n","* Encontrar el método que mejor se comporta utilizando los datos de prueba\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AB6lylPgqdPD"},"source":["***\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Aj_j0GehqdPD"},"source":["## Importar librerias y Definir Funciones Auxiliares\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"M9qxV_wKqdPE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679667533451,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1904,"user":{"displayName":"Maria Fernandez","userId":"14955728747412867423"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","from sklearn import preprocessing\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZyeM2T57qdPG"},"source":["Esta función sirve para visualizar la matriz de confusión.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"7EQWLEKsqdPG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679667548274,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":261,"user":{"displayName":"Maria Fernandez","userId":"14955728747412867423"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def plot_confusion_matrix(y,y_predict):\n","    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","\n","    cm = confusion_matrix(y, y_predict)\n","    ax= plt.subplot()\n","    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, ax = ax); \n","    ax.set_xlabel('Valores predecidos')\n","    ax.set_ylabel('Valores reales')\n","    ax.set_title('Confusion Matrix'); \n","    ax.xaxis.set_ticklabels(['no aterrizó', 'aterrizó']); ax.yaxis.set_ticklabels(['no aterrizó', 'aterrizó'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WSlrERjfqdPH"},"source":["## Cargar el dataframe\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zbb45XWtqdPH"},"source":["Cargar los datos\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"DaTTTpOXqdPH","outputId":"ede3019b-7432-4a74-8eb0-4b11264910eb","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":366},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679667548989,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Maria Fernandez","userId":"14955728747412867423"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   FlightNumber        Date BoosterVersion  PayloadMass  \\\n","0             1  2010-06-04       Falcon 9  6123.547647   \n","1             2  2012-05-22       Falcon 9   525.000000   \n","2             3  2013-03-01       Falcon 9   677.000000   \n","3             4  2013-09-29       Falcon 9   500.000000   \n","4             5  2013-12-03       Falcon 9  3170.000000   \n","\n","                     Payload Orbit    LaunchSite LandingOutcome  Flights  \\\n","0  Dragon Qualification Unit   LEO  CCSFS SLC 40      None None        1   \n","1         COTS Demo Flight 2   LEO  CCSFS SLC 40      None None        1   \n","2                      CRS-2   ISS  CCSFS SLC 40      None None        1   \n","3                   CASSIOPE    PO   VAFB SLC 4E    False Ocean        1   \n","4                      SES-8   GTO  CCSFS SLC 40      None None        1   \n","\n","   GridFins  ...
